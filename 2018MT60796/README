this code is written in python3 and GNU MP is installed to it. gmpy2 is used in the code and version 2.1.0.

code running instructions:
--> it was written in python3. the file is named as main.cpp. entire code is in one file.
--> "python3 main.py" will compile and execute the code.
--> output is not given to files but visible in the console.  
--> the key(prime and primative root) and message is given in the code.

working of hash function:

-> it takes binary sting of length 256 as input and outputs a binary string of 32 bytes. 
-> to convert the given message into a length a multiple of 256 we add spaces at the end.
-> every character ex-"A" is written as a 5 bits string ex-"01001=9".
-> hash function divides the hash into 4 equal parts say A,B,C,D. 
-> B,C,D are combined with a non linear function to give a 64 bit output . 
-> the given output is XOR with A (addition mod 2). to get E.
-> the final hash is DEBC(left shift for B,C,D).
-> de-hashing of a given binary hash is done on the principle if A xor B is C then B xor C is A.(A^B=C implies C^B=A)

working of symmetric key cryptosystem. 

-> it is inspired from DES(Data Encryption Standard) and working is similar except it only single round encryption.
